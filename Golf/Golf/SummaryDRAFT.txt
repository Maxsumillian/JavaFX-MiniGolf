NEWSTUFF I Had To Learn

+ private vs public variable. public can be accessed and changed outside of class while private requires gets and sets to change

+ How to Write and store files on a new Folder
+ Where to store files and how to read/parse and Write simple data that can be stored in files

+ Maven is a manager that automatically finds and downloads dependencies and manages libraries for you
+ How to Install Gson Library from Google to read and write json Files from javaFX

+ Learning how to use FXML and a sceneBuilder ( Note: Similar to HTML )
+ what is a fxml controller? (it connects with the fxml files and dictates what buttons and other stuff do)
+ how to link buttons and actions from fxml to controller (note: this is very nice how I can call the controller function and bind the action directly with fxml)

+ how to communicate between windows and change data/display information

+ why initializing the game is important when setting up variables that don't exist yet timing error

+ How A controller for fxml can be used to retrieve and store data for level creation
FXML > root-Loader > Controller > objects needed > Gc > game > display

+ How to use stylesheets and css

+ How to make Enums and use Enums

+ How to Make and populate a Dynamic List-View

+ How to import and play sounds

+ loading and unloading objects into json

+ Basic controls of debugger tool

========================================

Problems and solutions

How to load level from files and how to create and save files.

Step 1) Learn where to read and write Files Do not save in the resources file (once the app is packaged the JAR cannot be modified)
Step 2) Make a Folder for storing level data that can be written or read like "levels" in-side your project folder next to your "src" folder
Step 3) Files will be stored as json to store variables such as classes location etc.
Step 4) Get user input to store and write data to load later when needed.
... needs more work

Animation and Physics as a whole :|

step 1) figuring out how to display a ball (just print/Draw to your canvas, Note: make sure this is a method will need to be called a-lot)
step 2) how to draw a moving ball? (update its location every second and increment its position somehow)
step 3) how to update its location every second? (use a game loop or an animation timer part of java library)
step 4) how to decide to increment its movement? (make sure the ball has settable position and also make sure you can set a velocity for it)

Physics Part 2 walls! and friction

Walls!
walls are dynamic and varied by nature so its collision detection has to be more robust than the simple canvas size check
this requires finding the points of contact and conditions when the ball might hit those contact points besides this i also
needed a ways to scale the walls and be able to check all collisions for in all frames so i used an enhanced for loop to
check an arraylist of wall objects to compare x y length height positions it doesn't have any corner detections, but it works closely enough,
and it also cannot be rotated or at an angel i would probably have to do more math for that so i decided only rectangles :)
I opted for a simple solution of dynamically setting the walls in an array list

Ball movement?
step 1) identify how to increment your ball position (you would name a variable such as velocity to add to its x and y position every frame)
step 2) adding velocity every frame works, but it's all linear motion it would never slow down to get this slow down or friction
property we need to take the velocity and decrement it so the ball slows down over time. (eventually for things like a sand trap I will have a friction multiplier that gets applied to the velocity decrementing)


hole issues
program crashed only for randomized hole spawns
Step 1) When setting random hole spawns you must initialize first so the program can run it later so you don't get a null pointer error
this is because settings the position of a hole whose cords don't exist leads to a crash but by using an initialized function with a slight delay you can run your game then set teh parameters


How to make Good UI?

step 1) pick up a scene builder (this is a program or plugin that allows live editing and formating of windows and controls)
step 2) understand fxml needs a controller and that controller is able to handle your inputs easily for you.
step 3) understanding how to change/Carry Data from one Window to another(In my case I Set Stages as public static you cna alter and change from other controllers very helpful)
(hacking and security are not important to my program, so I may not be using best practice from a security poi, but it works for what I need it to)
(Well i actaully did end up changing it and it now uses a Mode manager to communicate between all the controllers)

CONNECTING FXML TO MY LEVELS!!!!
I can grab the file name and send it to my open level method that reads the files grabs the controller for the files and
is able to get the canvas and controls within the file to read location!!! what this means is I can build levels with my scene editor!


I was using public variables... that is bad practice
I made everything private with public gets and sets

I also don't have a structure with hierarchy when I should've easily made one, and then I could even add things like color


JSON AND LOADING?

Json doesn't Support Polymorphism normally But They way I load my game levels is by taking an object array list that uses
polymorphism to draw and apply collision methods, so I ran into a problem of saving and loading my objects.

step 1) if a Json cant take polymorphism separate teh list and save and load the list and combine
step 2) Make a levelData Container that organizes and stores my arraylist separately to reference from (this makes it clean and modular to break and add Objects later)
step 3) save individually
step 4) load individually then combine and return an arraylist of objects for my game

===================== NOTES =================

I'm tyring to figure out how I can make and test levels easily using the scene builder
I have a few options

option 1) I use the scene builder to reference for object position, size, and height and put that into a json file using gson

options 2) I use scene builder as a level editor :)
option 2 sounds more fun! but is a little different because you cannot put objects into a scenes with scene builder
you may only put shapes in the canvas.
to fix this I just make my own shapes/controls that extend from the shapes and store the positons just like my wall class
 This way I can still identity different properties I want those shapes to have like a ball wall sandbox water-pool etc

 step 1) figure out what I should make my parent for my wall class... Because I Want it to be placeable in teh fxml scene builder and I Want it to be able to be a shape
 After some research I found that I need to make it extend off of "region" Region is a core class of fxml It handles creating controls and containers it's capable of
 making buttons and more I use this because I want to bea ble to drag and move them a use positon and data form them. I also need the Wall class to be a Node so it
 can be used in the canvas/Window

became way more complicated than I needed but with the help of AI and some theory crafting I leaned that instead of trying
to mke my own "shapes" I can instead just use the ones they have and dynamically track how many they are and make mirror
objects of teh classes I use for my game logic

ex: rectangles are walls
ex: circle is sand trap
ex: ellipse is water
ex: check box is staring location (ie: ball location)
ex: progress bottom is hole location.



//////////////////////////////////////////

progress

Basic menu logic (DONE)
Basic ball and control logic (DONE)
Basic wall and obstacle logic (DONE)
Basic Level Editor (DONE)
User Level Editor (75%)
Save file System (DONE)
Full Menu System (80%)
Score System (50%)

// Note: I reVamped and Remade all my classes to all be children of Object class this cleans up my code for my running
game function by making collision and drawing modular. it now uses polymorphism to achieve all its task. before this I
had each class seperated and just had multiple loops running for my logic

NOTE: I should only have one window for the game screen because if I have more than one game running I won't know what
level to save from my save button

or alternatively I can move my save button to The game screen and then I can save whatever level I want

well we are changing things up my main menu will have a load level and score button on play it display score on edit it
has a load level button while my edit screen shows controls and overall score throughout the whole game


Dragging is so Cool in my edit mode it disables the bal movement, but instead you can drag and move objects around it
basically checks to see if the mouse is sharing the same space as an object and if it is and It's still being dragged it
changes that object location. also note that you can do this in my premade leaves but i will have to add some type of
check on the save so if you click edit on a premade level it instead saves it as a custom level

I used chatgpt to get the Focus screen I understand it has a game manager that controllers who's the focus and on touch it
changes it and passes it to the menus related but i don't know they talk to each other I know its through an interface
and listening
